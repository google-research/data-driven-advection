# Super-resolution methods for solving 2D PDEs

This is not an official Google product.

# Installation (MacOS/Linux)
Installation is most easily done using pip:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/googleprivate/pde-superresolution-2d.git
pip install -e pde-superresolution-2d
```
Note that we assume TensorFlow is already installed. We chose not to include tensorflow in the python dependencies, because installing it automatically might override the gpu version of it.
